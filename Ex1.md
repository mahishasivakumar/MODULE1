# Ex.Name:Write a C++ Program to read two sequence of character  value from the keyboard and display the value on the monitor?
## Date:
## Aim:
To write a C++ program that reads two sequences of character values from the keyboard and displays them on the monitor.

## Algorithm:
STEP 1: Start the program.

STEP 2: Declare two string variables to store the sequences.

STEP 3: Display the message “Enter first sequence of characters:”.

STEP 4: Read the first sequence from the keyboard.

STEP 5: Display the message “Enter second sequence of characters:”.

STEP 6: Read the second sequence from the keyboard.

STEP 7: Move to output section.

STEP 8: Display “The sequences you entered are:” on the monitor.

STEP 9: Print the first and second sequences.

STEP 10: End the program.


## Program:
```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    string a,b;
    cin>>a>>b;
    
    cout<<"First Value is:"<<a<<endl;
    cout<<"Second Value is:"<<b<<endl;
}
```


## Output:
<img width="844" height="305" alt="{473923BE-C8F9-419E-9370-FE716A2F96D4}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d61f647-b3f6-4cb7-8365-8f5561c13b64" />



## Result:
Thus, the C++ program was written and executed successfully. It reads two sequences of characters from the keyboard and displays them on the monitor.
